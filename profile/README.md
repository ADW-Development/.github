# 🛠️ADW Development🛠️

### ADW Development is a Scratch Studio

Founded in 2024, ADW Development makes anything possible from 3D to 2D. Everything is possible in ADW Development. It was created by [@SwordFish16](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/SwordFish16/) (Current CEO) and [@DA_FWOGGY_POATO](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/DA_FWOGGY_POATO/) with the purpose of expanding the boundaries of Scratch programming to incomprehensible lengths. 

Ever since it was founded, ADW Development has been expanding, even outside of Scratch. We continue to create mind-blowing open-source programs for all.
